React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript 
library[3] for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) 
and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development
 of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that 
 state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as
  well as certain client-side functionality.The Greeter function is a React component that accepts a property greeting.
   The variable App is an instance of the Greeter component where the greeting property is set to 'Hello, World!'.
    The ReactDOM.render method then renders the Greeter component inside the DOM element with id myReactApp.

When displayed in a web browser the result will be:
</p>
</div>
)
}
