    <p className="text-center fw-bold mt-5 ">Companies using React Native seek to prioritize performance but also efficiency. 

Most developers agree that native apps are the way to go when it comes to building mobile applications. 

However, in 2015, Facebook saw the opportunity for a React-based framework geared towards mobile development and created React Native to help businesses build hybrid apps. 

In this piece, you’ll learn more about the companies using React Native and why they felt it was the best fit for their brand and business. Keep reading to see if React Native might be right for your business. 
Native apps are developed to work only on the platforms they are built for. Naturally, this is a disadvantage for most businesses who want their apps on every app store possible, and don’t look forward to taking the time to release an app on one store just to build a new one for the next.

Developing an app for iOS, Android, and possibly Windows is time-consuming, strenuous work.

You need Java developers to develop for Android and Swift or Objective-C developers for iOS and so on. At the same time, businesses don’t want to sacrifice performance or functionality, which can be the cost of non-native apps.</p></div>
